                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, widely known as the "Missile Man of India,
                    " was an inspiring figure whose contributions to science, education, and society have left an
                    indelible mark. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings
                    to become a prominent scientist and, eventually, the 11th President of India.
                    Kalam played a pivotal role in India's defense and space programs, particularly in developing
                    ballistic missile technology and launching India's satellite programs. His work on the Pokhran-II
                    nuclear tests in 1998 solidified India's place as a nuclear power. However, it was not just his
                    scientific acumen that endeared him to the nationâ€”it was his humility, simplicity, and deep concern
                    for the younger generation.
